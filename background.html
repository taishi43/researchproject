    <h1>Background</h1>
	  <h2>Who are Asian Americans?</h2>
	    <div id="who">
		    <p>Much of the existing academic work on "Asian Americans" encounters the same problems it seems; firstly, there is too much diversity, whether it be in ethnicity, socioeconomic status, recency of immigration, or a variety of other factors, as evidenced by the monolithic grouping done in <a href="https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/PSDT_07.01.20_racism.covid_Full.Report.pdf">this Pew article</a> with little respect towards how it may have disproportionately affected certain ethnic groups. Secondly, the population is considered too small for a statistically significant sample size as evidenced by <a href="https://www.immigrationresearch.org/system/files/Asian%20Americans%20and%20their%20origins_%20Key%20facts%20_%20Pew%20Research%20Center.pdf">this article.</a></p>
    <br>
		    <div id="introduction">
      <p>By highlighting the difficulty presented by prejudiced behaviors against the broader diversity of the monolithic “Asian American” group, I hope to encourage a greater degree of consideration and nuance to those–academic or otherwise–who may perceive Asian Americans differently as well as to offer an insight into the experiences of Asians in a way that avoids the sampling difficulties mentioned in the Pew discrimination article.</p>
