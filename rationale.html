    <h1>Rationale</h1>  
    <div id="introduction">
      <p>As an Asian American, I have firsthand experience with the uniting difficulties and shared culture some other Japanese Americans may experience with certain Asian American groups, but I also have experience with feeling very little cultural bond other than the American part of Asian American with certain Asian groups. In the aftermath of a rise in anti Asian racism and hate crimes during the early stages of the COVID 19 pandemic, I want to be able to better understand how experiences may be different or similar between Asians in the US and to convey that to others. I think if more people in the United States have greater understanding of Asian Americans and the impacts of racism and racial violence, there will be a lower amount of discrimination and prejudice. 
<br>
	      This is dependent on being able to accurately isolate the shared cultural experiences of different Asian American groups that are unique to those groups, but also to understand how the harms of generalization have negatively impacted cultural groups of great difference in similar ways.</p>
