    <h1>Methods and Design</h1>  
    <div id="introduction">
	    <h2>Approach</h2>
      <p>The study will utilize a phenomenological approach to data and their gathering. The data will primarily be collected through interviews with subjects, as well as people close to the subjects. This will be most suitable for the study as it gives control of the narratives to the subjects regarding their experiences with anti-Asian hate crimes in an open-ended manner that will impart the least bias onto what can be varying experiences among different subjects. Any individual of Asian descent in the Portland metro area who claims to have experienced racially motivated violence or assault of any kind can be a viable participant. This can mean a great variety in socioeconomic status, age, and potentially linguistic abilities.</p>
	    <br>
	    <h2>Ethical Concerns and Recruitment</h2>
	    <p>The potential for linguistic diversity may necessitate the employment of interpreters. Furthermore, interviews will be conducted in a way that is compliant with the COVID-19 restrictions that are applicable at the time of interview. To be ethically responsible in this study involving human subjects, there will be attempts made to protect the identities and confidentiality of participants, as well as offering a detailed description of how information will be collected and may be used prior to requesting their consent to participate. This necessarily complicates the recruitment process however, as referral from other persons can be potentially exposing. As hate crimes were often the subject of news articles when they were approaching peak frequency, articles and reports will offer a starting point from which we will be able to directly contact potential participants.</p>
	<br>
	    <h2>Interview Structure</h2>
	    <p>Stimuli will ideally be kept minimal and usage of potentially biased language will be predicated upon the usage of the same language by the participants first. The main goal of this structure is to encourage narratives from the subjects that contextualize their experiences within their perceptions of the environment in which they occurred, whether that is a neighborhood, the Portland metro area, or even the United States, and then to understand how those perceptions affect how they described their experiences. If applicable, willing friends or relatives of the primary subjects would also be interviewed to understand the broader impacts on those close to victims of such hate crimes and the larger communities, as well as to add another layer of depth to the initial narrative.</p>
	<br>
	    <h2>Methods of Analysis</h2>
	    <p>Thematic analysis will be a primary tool to identify commonalities between the narratives from the verbatim transcripts obtained during interviews. The approach will be an inductive one as the variance between the context and details of each experience may be greater than convenient for a deductive analysis. If from the data themes are able to be found which then enhance our collective understanding of the impacts of such racially motivated violence then the study will have been successful.</p>
